# Engineering progression

In VirtusLab we have several levels of progression for engineering positions. This serves double purpose.

#### Gives a clear guideline for career progression

Clear progression is useful both for all employees and folks outside of company considering joining us. **It's worth to mention however that - as most of things in this handbook - it's descriptive, not prescriptive.** We have folks who advanced much faster on the progression levels than their years of experience would indicate. In contrast, we often have engineers applicating with long experience (indicating senior positions) who we would assign to _regular_ role. This often happens for folks we perceive as _an expert beginners_ ([as wonderfully depicted by Erik Dietrich](https://www.daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/)). Another interesting question that emphasizes this phenomenon is the following question: "Have you got 5 years of experience or one year repeated 5 times?".

We would like to believe that we are mostly driven by meritocracy standards. Your contributions matter, not the length of your CV.

#### Provides transparency 

Whereas we do not have full transparency for all the salaries within company, we do have transparent salary ranges for given positions & progression levels. We are keeping salary range for given progression level rather narrow so that it serves the purpose of transparency without loosing the possibility to recognize & reward differences in contributions to the bottom line. 

# Progression levels

Progression level is basically a fancy term for _job title_. It mostly reflects the scope of work particular engineer is capable of driving or the impact the engineer has on the organization as whole. It would be beneficial to read first about our [company model and growth strategies](company-model.md) - this will give you the background and reasons behind the major factors driving career progression.

Levels proceed sequentially. There are two main drivers behind carreer progression:

* Ability to organize or manage (whatever that means) larger group of engineers. That is in simple terms called - leadership skills.

* Excellent technical expertise connected with skills and achievements in spreading the knowledge within and outside of the company.

Increase of abilities connected with solid track record in above directions is the thing that gives you promotion. Apart from these there are other skills / characteristic that are important on any level of engineering progression - baseline traits. These are:

* Actively seeking knowledge & understanding. "Life is a study" approach.

* Getting things done.

* Clear & honest communication.

* Personal responsibility.

* Being a team player.

An individual who falls short on these base characteristics will not be able to progress (or even keep his position within company) even if (s)he is a world-wide renowned technical speaker.

We have basically five levels of engineering positions - ranging from _junior_ to _principal_. Truth be said, although we mostly hire engineers from _regular_ up to _principal_ positions continuously, we rather do not keep the same pace with _junior_ positions. We only open _junior_ position recruitment from time to time. While we recognize the value of bringing _junior_ engineers on board we would like to maintain the level of experienced professionals in our ranks to be the significant majority. 

You would also find that most of the levels indicate experience levels (as counted in years) significantly higher than industry standards these days (at least in Poland, where we are based). It is not uncommon to see engineers with _senior_ titles who have e.g. less than 3 years of experience under their belt and worked only with single technology or single type of software (say intranet web application). While we certainly believe this is technically possible we are rather sceptical and are deliberately trying to avoid _title inflation_.

Usually participates in recruitment processes.

##### Experience

Usually at least 5-8 years of professional experience **and** worked with multiple technologies / domains. 

#### Senior engineer
