# Engineering progression

In Virtus Lab we have several levels of progression for engineering positions. This serves double purpose:

#### Gives a clear guideline for career progression

Clear progression is useful both for all employees and folks outside of company considering joining us. It's worth to mention however that - as most of things in this handbook - it's descriptive, not prescriptive. We have folks who advanced much faster on the progression levels than their years of experience would indicate. In contrast, we often have engineers aplicating with long experience (indicating senior positions) who we would assign to _regular_ role. This often happens for folks we perceive as _an expert beginners_ ([as wonderfully depicted by Erik Dietrich](https://www.daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/)). Another interesting question that emphasizes this phenomenon is the following question: "Have you got 5 years of experience or one year repeated 5 times?".

We would like to believe that we are mostly driven by meritocracy standards. Your contributions matter, not the length of your CV.

#### Provides transparency 

Whereas we do not have full transparency for all the salaries within company, we do have transparent salary ranges for given positions & progression levels. We are keeping salary range for given progression level rather narrow so that it serves the purpose of transparency without loosing the possibility to recognize & reward differences in contributions to the bottom line. 

# Progression levels

Progression level is basically a fancy term for _job title_. It mostly reflects the scope of work work particular engineer is capable of driving. Progression levels range from _junior_ to _lead_. Truth be said, although we mostly hire engineers from _regular_ up to _lead_ positions continously, we rather don't keep the same pace with _junior_ positions. We only open _junior_ position recruitment from time to time.
