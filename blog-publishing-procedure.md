# Blog post publishing procedure

1) Before doing anything else make sure you read your blog post few times to correct all language and any substantive mistakes you can spot. If your blog post contains fragments of code or links to the sources (e.g. on github), please test that they all compile and work. Also make sure that referenced resources are public.
2) Save your blog post on google docs and give the right to commenting to everyone in the _virtuslab.com_ organisation who have the link. Send that link to [blog@virtuslab.com](mailto:blog@virtuslab.com) to begin the review process.
If you want, you can propose someone who should be part of this review, e.g. a colleague who knows the relevant technologies well.
3) Check all comments and suggestions which will appear in the document and fix all the issues. You will have to go through both language and the technical review.
4) Check the final version of your blog post on [https://virtuslab.com/blog/](https://virtuslab.com/blog/) when asked.
