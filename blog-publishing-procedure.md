# Blog post publishing procedure

1) Before doing anything else make sure you read your blog post few times and corrected all language and substantive mistakes you can spot. If your blog post contains fragments of code or links to the sources (e.g. on github) please test if all of them compile and work. Also make sure that referenced resources are public.
2) Save your blog post on google docs and give the right to commenting everyone in the _virtuslab.com_ organisation who have the link. Send that link to the [blog@virtuslab.com](mailto:blog@virtuslab.com) to begin review process.
If you want you can propose someone who should be part of this review, e.g. colleague who knows well technologies you are describing.
3) Check all comments and suggestions which will appear in document and fix all the issues. You will have to go through both language and technical review.
4) Check final version of your blog post visible on [https://virtuslab.com/blog/](https://virtuslab.com/blog/) when you will be asked for it.
